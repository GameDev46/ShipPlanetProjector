## Info

This mod adds a holographic projection of the currently selected planet in the ship's log and a little ship model which represents your ship's current position relative to the selected body

## Credits

Huge thanks to [MegaPiggy](https://github.com/MegaPiggy) for the [AdvancedMinimap.cs file](https://github.com/MegaPiggy/SBtT.GeneralEnhancements/blob/a2b3d76eeeaebe339a4bbae57b7ab31610778f03/GeneralEnhancements/AdvancedMinimap.cs) in the [General Enhancements mod for Outer Wilds](https://github.com/MegaPiggy/SBtT.GeneralEnhancements/) as this was what helped me to understand how to clone the planet proxy models ready to be used for the holographic display, I reccomend you check their mod out too!

## Usage

To turn on the projector you can use the metal control box to the left of the cockpit chair and then the projector will display the current focused planet in the ship's log

## Known Issues

Giant's Deep is barely visible - this is due to the cloud layer thinking you are too close and not rendering as a result (which is why you can see a faint outline)
